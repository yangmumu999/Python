# Python
1.	Basic practices related to math, data types, and string.

3.	A supermarket shopping game: the customer can choose either to buy a lottery ticket or buy certain items. The system will calculate the remaining and print out the items that the custom gets.
	
5.	A card game named “21”. There are two players: one human player and one computer player. To play, the players take turns requesting cards, trying to get as close to 21 as possible, but not going over 21. A player may pass. Once a player has passed, he or she cannot later ask for another card. When all players have passed, the game ends. The winner is the player who has come closest to 21 without exceeding it. In the case of a tie, or if everyone goes over 21, no one wins. The "cards" are the numbers 1 through 10 (randomly generated). The odds of returning a 10 are four times as likely as any other value (because in an actual deck of cards, 10, Jack, Queen, and King all count as 10).

7.	A game named “pick your letters”. In this game, the players need to re-arrange a group of cards to make up a word. The players get cards randomly at first round. Then they can either change a card or pass the round. By changing a card, they can either choose from the shuffled pile (the card is unknown) or choose the top card of the discarded pile (the card is known). The player who makes up a word first wins the game.

9.	A bank program that manages bank accounts and allows for deposits, withdrawals, purchases, sorting bank accounts based on different criteria, and exporting bank statements. The program will initially load a list of accounts from a .txt file, and deposits and withdrawals from additional .csv files. Then it will parse and combine all the data and store it in a dictionary. 

11.	Analyzing data about movies and ratings from the IMDB website and get to use functions from the pandas module for loading, inspecting and querying the data. Performing some operations on joining the data, slicing rows, and querying data using Boolean indexing. Using functions in the NumPy library, and performing analysis on summarizing data, creating pivot tables, and applying aggregate functions. Drawing figures based on the matplotlib library.
